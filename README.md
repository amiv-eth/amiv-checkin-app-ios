# AMIV Check-in App - iOS

## Summary 
This app is an iOS equivalent of the [AMIV Check-in Android app](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/amiv/amiv-checkin), which was developed first. So for further info, how to use etc, see the other repo. Also see the [server side and website project](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/amiv/amiv-checkin).

## How to Install
Currently the app is only available by installation directly from XCode.

## What works

- Communication with server (includes request, as well as response)
- Scanning Legis with camera to check students in and out of events
- Freebee events and checkin events
- Statistics overview over the whole event. This includes basic information of the event, the students that attend it, as well as other good to know statistics info.

## What still needs to be done

- Searching through statistics
- Some more UI and UX work
- More code documentation
- Write tests
